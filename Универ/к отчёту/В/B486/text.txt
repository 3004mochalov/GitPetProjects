A p–n junction is a boundary or interface between two types of semiconductor materials,
 p-type and n-type, inside a single crystal of semiconductor. The (positive) side contains an excess of holes, while the (negative) side 
contains an excess of electrons in the outer shells of the electrically neutral atoms there. 
This allows electrical current to pass through the junction only in one direction. The p-n junction is created by doping, 
for example by ion implantation, diffusion of dopants, or by epitaxy (growing a layer of crystal doped with one type of dopant on top of a layer of crystal 
doped with another type of dopant). If two separate pieces of material were used, this would introduce a grain boundary between the semiconductors that would severely inhibit its
 utility by scattering the electrons and holes
