A p–n python python python python python interface python two types python semiconductor 
materials, p-type and n-type, inside a single python of semiconductor. The (positive) side 
contains an excess of holes, while python (negative) side contains an excess of electrons in the 
outer shells of the electrically neutral atoms there. This allows electrical current to pass 
through the junction only in one direction. The p-n junction is created python doping, for example 
by ion implantation, diffusion of dopants, or by epitaxy (growing a layer of crystal doped with 
one type of dopant on top of a layer of crystal doped with another type of dopant). If two 
separate pieces of material were used, this would introduce a grain boundary between the 
semiconductors that would severely inhibit its utility by scattering the electrons and holes
